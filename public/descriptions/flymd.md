The Irvine joins the [Grand River](#grand) just below the put-in for the main Elora Gorge runs, and is usually run from the Irvine St. Bridge in Fergus to the Grand River Conservation Area take-out (the end-point for most Grand River runs as well). In Winter and Spring, dramatic ice formations line the steep canyon walls for a spectacular run. The Irvine can be run at flows ~8CMS and above on the [Water Office Gauge](https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/report/real_time_e.html?stn=02GA005), though a portage is requried at  the dam (see below) with levels below 20CMS (**CHECK THIS NUMBER**).

There are three major features on the Irvine section, joined by several wave trains and small drops. At higher water levels (30CMS and above) they form a near-continuous ride.
- **bridge rapids** (name?) is a Class II-III section just below the put-in
- **the Salem Dam** is the defining feature of the run, a 12-foot slide/falls run river-right of the dam itself. **NOT RUNNABLE AT LEVELS BELOW 20CMS**, and potentially very dangerous due to a very hard landing, it becomes a surprisingly doable otter slide at moderate river levels. Portage river-left around the mill building and down the Whitewater Ontario steps (get the combination from someone who knows it before you leave!)
- **triple Step** is a two-step drop about 500m downriver of the dam
