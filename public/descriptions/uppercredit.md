A rare gem that requires a good flood to run, the upper Credit is steeper and has more continuous whitewater than most other Southern Ontario rivers.  A long upper section Class II/III empties into a mill pond about halfway down the run. Below the falls is a beautiful canyon section that ends in a steep Class III+ feature that often collects wood. **Scouting here is mandatory**. In Spring, the scout/portage can be extremely slippery with packed snow, and proper shoes with good treads are strongly recommended. A put-in below the just-mentioned feature leads to another long stretch of II+ rapids with occasional hazards. Take-out is just below the bridge at Dominion Road, recognizable by the usually-crowded parking lane along the side of Forks of the Credit Road. The take-out also gives good access to the Bruce Trail and therefore allows some scouting by foot if this is desired.
