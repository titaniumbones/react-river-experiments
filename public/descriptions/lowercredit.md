The Credit River watershed extends north and east of Lake Ontario from
Port Credit in the south, to around the town of Orangeville in the
north. Much of the river is apparently navigable. The journey from
Orangeville in the North has been written up on the [Credit Valley
Conservation Area web
site](https://web.archive.org/web/20130620202405/http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/recandleisure/canoeing.htm "http://www.creditvalleyca.ca/recandleisure/canoeing.htm").
The section popular among white water enthusiasts is generally found to
the south in Mississauga from the Streetsville area to Erindale Park. In
this section, the river is banked on both sides by parkland and
semi-wilderness and can be quite pretty. The section south of Erindale
Park to Port Credit on Lake Ontario generally has less appealing
scenery. Here, the river travels through some semi-wilderness, a golf
course and eventually pours into a long, flat, man-made water way. The
run from Erindale Park to Port Credit contains two short boulder
gardens, but is generally slower moving and finishes with a flat water
paddle of perhaps 3 km.

The whitewater section from Streetsville to Erindale Park is [Class
II](/web/20130620202405/http://www.whitewaterontario.ca:80/rivers/index.php/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty#CII "International Scale of River Difficulty")
but could be [Class
III](/web/20130620202405/http://www.whitewaterontario.ca:80/rivers/index.php/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty#CIII "International Scale of River Difficulty")
in spring flood due to the lack of eddies.

Main Access Point:

To access the Credit in Streetsville use the Streetsville Memorial Park
access near the Vic Johnston Arena.

Alternative Access Point:

An alternative access point is located below the Eglinton Ave West
Bridge (Vehicle access through Culham Trail - entrance located at the SE
end of the bridge). This access point allows you to enter just south of
the Dam and misses no major features.

Technical difficulty was not much more than class II, but due to the
lack of eddies and a couple of hazards to dodge it is class III

Main feature to be aware off is about 400m downstream of the put in.
Just around a bend is a major dam. We skirted the dam using a channel on
river left that was accessed before the dam was insight. Dam is visible
from google maps.

Rest of the river was a long entertaining run.

The current level for this river can be found through the [Environment
Canada Real-Time Hydrometric Data site, gauge 02HB029 "CREDIT RIVER AT
STREETSVILLE"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130620202405/http://www.wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/graph/graph_e.html?stn=02HB029 "http://www.wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/graph/graph_e.html?stn=02HB029")Environment
Canada Real-Time Hydrometric Data site, gauge 02HB029 "CREDIT RIVER AT
STREETSVILLE".

At 5.7 river is very high. Lots of features and all play waves are
washed out. At lower levels(as low as 4.7) there are a few play waves on
the way. Good section of water for eddy hopping close to the takeout.
