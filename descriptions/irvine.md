The Irvine is a tributary of the Grand River with a runnable section that merges with the Elora Gorge run on the main stem of that river. Generally extremely low in the summer, it is subject to flooding in the spring, leading to a beautiful Class III/IV run with long stretches of continuous whitewater. Significant features include:

- Triple Drop, a III+ series of ledges with an intermittent significant hole at the bottom of the drop, river right;
- a steep dam drop, runnable only at fairly high water levels;
- a long canyon section, continuous III at high levels

Shortly after the canyon, the Irvine merges with the Elora Gorge run, which will generally be running fairly high if the Irvine has come in.
