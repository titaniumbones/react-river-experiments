The Grand River is a large river in southwestern Ontario, Canada. From
its source, it flows south through Grand Valley, Fergus, Elora,
Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge, Paris, Brantford, Caledonia, and Cayuga
before emptying into the north shore of Lake Erie south of Dunnville at
Port Maitland. One of the scenic and spectacular features of the river
is the falls and gorge at Elora.([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_River_(Ontario)))

The section of the Grand must commonly run is often called the "Elora Run" and  extends from just below [the Tooth of Time](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNQD9ZVe0WApvSUGd1wrvnUgNNeLRQ:1575925373870&q=tooth+of+time+elora&tbm=isch&source=univ&client=firefox-b-d&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG-OfAu6nmAhVNTd8KHSD9BYAQsAR6BAgFEAE&biw=1483&bih=869) to just before a low-head dam near the southern parking lot of the GRCA recreation area. There are several small sets in the Class II/II+ range, including reliable surf waves at most levels. The most significant feature is The Chute, a class II/III/III+ set with interesting contours and several runnable lines, about half way through the run. 

In summer, the section from the Chute to the take-out is popular with tubers; dodging these tourists can be something of a challenge in an otherwise mild, low-water season.
